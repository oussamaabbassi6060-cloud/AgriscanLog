# Admin Dashboard Fixes - Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Role Update Functionality (API)
**File:** `/app/api/admin/users/route.ts`

Added a new `PUT` method handler (`handleUpdateUser`) with the following features:
- **Super Admin permissions:**
  - Can change any user's role to `admin` or `user`
  - Cannot promote users to `super_admin` role
  - Cannot change their own role
  
- **Admin permissions:**
  - Can only change user roles to `user` (cannot promote to admin)
  - Cannot change roles of other admins or super admins
  - Cannot change their own role

- **Security features:**
  - Prevents self-role changes
  - Validates role values
  - Prevents modification of super admin roles
  - Returns appropriate error messages for unauthorized actions

### 2. Updated Admin Dashboard UI
**File:** `/components/admin-dashboard.tsx`

#### Role Management UI:
- Added dropdown selectors for role changes in the User Management section
- The dropdown only appears for users whose roles can be changed based on current user permissions:
  - Super admins see dropdowns for all users except other super admins (can set to admin or user)
  - Admins see dropdowns only for regular users (can only set to user)
  - Super admin roles are displayed as badges (cannot be changed)
- Added loading state during role updates
- Integrated with the new PUT endpoint

#### Team Management Fixes:
- Added a refresh button for the Team Management section
- Added `useEffect` hook to re-fetch teams when switching to the Team Management tab
- Teams now fetch automatically when the tab becomes active
- Added loading spinner animation to the refresh button
- Improved team data fetching reliability

### 3. Permission Structure

The implementation follows this permission hierarchy:

| Current User Role | Can Change Roles Of | Available Role Options |
|-------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| Super Admin | Regular Users & Admins | User, Admin |
| Admin | Regular Users Only | User |
| User | No permissions | N/A |

### 4. User Experience Improvements
- Toast notifications for successful and failed operations
- Automatic refresh of user list and stats after role changes
- Disabled state for dropdowns during updates
- Clear visual distinction between role types using badges and icons
- Responsive loading states

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test as Super Admin:**
   - Verify you can change user roles to admin or user
   - Verify you cannot change super admin roles
   - Verify Team Management tab loads and refreshes correctly

2. **Test as Admin:**
   - Verify you can only change regular user roles to user
   - Verify you cannot change admin or super admin roles
   - Verify you don't see the Team Management tab

3. **Test Team Management:**
   - Click the refresh button to ensure teams reload
   - Switch between tabs to verify auto-refresh works
   - Create new teams and verify they appear immediately

## Files Modified
1. `/app/api/admin/users/route.ts` - Added PUT handler for role updates
