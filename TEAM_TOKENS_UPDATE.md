# Team Member Tokens Implementation

## Overview
Fixed the misunderstanding about how team API keys work. The system now correctly displays **AgriScan tokens from user profiles** instead of manually added API keys.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ **New Token Endpoint**
Created `/api/teams/tokens` endpoint that:
- Fetches tokens directly from the `profiles` table for all team members
- Returns each member's AgriScan authentication token
- Implements proper masking for security (shows first 6 and last 4 characters)
- Allows authorized users to view full tokens

### 2. üîë **Team Admin Dashboard Updates**
The "AgriScan API Keys" tab now correctly shows:
- **Team Member Tokens**: Each member's individual AgriScan token from their profile
- **Member Information**: Username, email, role, join date, and credits
- **Token Display**: Masked by default with option to reveal full token
- **Copy Functionality**: Ability to copy tokens to clipboard
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh button to get latest member tokens

### 3. üéØ **How It Works Now**

#### Token Access Flow:
1. Each user has their own unique AgriScan token in their profile
2. When users join a team, their token becomes accessible to team members
3. Team members can use each other's tokens for plant scanning
4. Tokens are automatically generated when users create their profiles

#### Permissions:
- **Team Owners/Admins**: Can view and copy full tokens
- **Team Members**: Can see masked tokens
- **All Members**: Can use shared tokens for AgriScan API calls

### 4. üìù **Removed Features**
- Removed manual "Add API Key" functionality (not needed since tokens come from profiles)
- Removed the old API key management system
- Cleaned up unnecessary API key CRUD operations

## Technical Implementation

### Database Structure:
```sql
profiles table:
- id
- username
- email
- token (AgriScan authentication token)
- role
- points
```

### API Response Format:
```json
{
  "tokens": [
    {
      "user_id": "...",
      "username": "John Doe",
      "email": "john@example.com",
      "team_role": "member",
      "token": {
        "value": "a1b2c3...xyz789",
        "masked": false,
        "exists": true
      },
      "points": 100
    }
  ],
  "canViewFull": true
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Simplified System**: No need to manually manage API keys
2. **Automatic Sharing**: Tokens are automatically shared when users join teams
3. **Security**: Tokens are masked by default, only authorized users can view full tokens
4. **Resource Pooling**: Teams can effectively share scanning credits
5. **Centralized Management**: All tokens come from user profiles, single source of truth

## Testing Checklist

- [x] View team member tokens in the Team Admin Dashboard
- [x] Verify tokens are pulled from profiles table
- [x] Test token masking/unmasking functionality
- [x] Confirm copy to clipboard works
- [x] Check refresh button updates token list
- [x] Verify proper permissions (admins can view full, members see masked)

## Files Changed

1. **Created**: `/app/api/teams/tokens/route.ts` - New endpoint for fetching member tokens
2. **Modified**: `/components/team-admin-dashboard.tsx` - Updated to display member tokens
3. **Modified**: Team deletion logic to handle cascading deletes properly

## Current Status
‚úÖ System is now correctly displaying team member AgriScan tokens from the profiles table
‚úÖ Teams can share and access each other's tokens for collaborative plant scanning
‚úÖ Proper security with token masking and permission-based access
